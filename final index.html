			<h1>Projects and Ideas</h1>
			<p>Our team is currently undertaking a project, “Find Me A Room” (FMAR), that will aid employees, both current and potential employees, find accommodation with ease. This is by offering reliable and accurate data on available rentals with the nearest proximity to their places of work.What we seek to address is the resource and time wastage when looking for accommodation. We believe that by providing a platform that offers information on available rentals, we curb this which would then not only benefit the students but the landlords themselves through the listing of their rentals.</p>
			<p> This one of the many planned projects that are to be undertaken in the year 2020, implementing web programming in the design of the FMAR website. </p>
